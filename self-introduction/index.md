Hi. My name is Eugene, i'm 21. I do Front-end Development.
When i was 19 i graduated from Yanka Kupala Grodno State University with a degree electronics engineering but i didn't stop and
since december 2022 i studying for the Front-end Development in Rolling Scopes School. 
Originally i'm from Belarus, but in august 2021 i moved to Poland in Warsaw and stayed to live here.
Now Let me tell about my work experience: I have got my first job when i was 15. That's was a car factory and i spent the whole summer before going to University. During my studies, in 2020, I started working as a croupier in an online casino and that's was start of my road to my dream. I started to saving my money for moving to Poland. After moving to Poland i continued to work as croupier, but already in an offline casino, face to face with people. It was a really interesting experience, there were a lot of
math and communication with polish- and english- speakers, that's why, i guess, i have good communicative  skills in those languages. But working in the casino is a lot of nightlife, and i understood that this is not for me. That's how i decided to change my profession and choose a programming.
Currently, I spend a lot of time to studying. I try to fully immerse myself in my studies and discover something new and ofcourse use this knowledge in projects.
This is the first time I enjoy studying because it is my only my conscious and independent choice.
I really enjoy when people praise my work on Cross-Check, saying that this is the best work, this won’t let me give up.
In my free time, I play the guitar and sing - this is an integral part of me!
In the future i see myself only as Developer and that's how i stay motivated all the time.
By the way, I am sure that in the future I will be thankful to myself for not wasting my time on drinking, parties and idleness.
That’s it. See you!
